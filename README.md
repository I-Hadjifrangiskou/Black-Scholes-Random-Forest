# Random Forest Approximation of Black-Scholes Option Pricing

## Overview

This project uses a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to approximate European option prices generated by the Black-Scholes formula. It is designed to explore how well a non-parametric machine learning model can learn the pricing behavior of call and put options from synthetic data.

---

## Key Features

-  **Synthetic Option Pricing**: Generates European option prices using the Black-Scholes model.
-  **Random Forest Regression**: Trains separate RF models to predict call and put prices from input features.
-  **Performance Evaluation**: Computes **Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE)** for both call and put predictions.
-  **Visualizations**: Produces scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices to assess model performance visually.

## File Structure

- `black_scholes_random_forest.py`: Main script for data generation, model training, evaluation, and plotting.
- (Run the script to generate prediction plots for call and put options.)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How It Works

1. **Data Generation**
   - Randomly samples input features: stock price (S), strike price (K), time to maturity (T), and volatility (Ïƒ).
   - Computes option prices using the Black-Scholes formula for both calls and puts.

2. **Model Training**
   - Trains separate `RandomForestRegressor` models for call and put prices using `scikit-learn`.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Predicts prices on the test set and evaluates performance using NMSE.
   - Generates scatter plots to visualize the accuracy of predictions.

## Example Output

 **Prediction Visualization**  
Scatter plots are generated comparing true vs. predicted prices for:
- Call options
- Put options

These allow visual inspection of model fit and bias.

## Future Improvements

- Use more advanced ML models (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks).
- Extend to pricing under more complex models (e.g., stochastic volatility, jump diffusion).
- Add sensitivity analysis or feature importance plots.
